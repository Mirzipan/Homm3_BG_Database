# Morale

Players can gain or lose morale through various game effects.

Here is a quick reference of what happens to the player's morale depending on what their starting morale was.

![Positive Morale Token](../assets/tokens-morale-positive.webp){ width=100 align=left }

A Positive Morale Token may be spent to perform any of these actions at any time (including right before gaining a second Positive Morale Token):

- Draw a Card from your Deck.
- Discard any number of Cards, then draw that many Cards.
- Reroll any [Die](dice.md) you have thrown.


## Negative

Also shown as :morale_negative:.

![Negative Morale Token](../assets/tokens-morale-negative.webp){ width=100 align=left }

A Negative Morale Token cannot be spent to perform any action.
Players can only get rid of it by gaining a [Positive Morale Token](morale.md#positive) or another Negative Morale Token.
Gaining a second Negative Morale Token will result in the player having to discard their hand of cards the next time they would end their Turn.


## Notes

- The [Necropolis :necropolis:](../towns/necropolis.md) ignores any changes in Morale. They can neither gain nor lose Morale.
