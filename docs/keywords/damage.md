# :damage: Damage


## Notes

- Should a [unit](../units/index.md) receive damage from any source, it will be subtracted from its [health points](health_points.md) directly. The [defense value](defense_value.md) only reduces the [attack value](attack_value.md) of a [unit](../units/index.md), but no the damage received.
