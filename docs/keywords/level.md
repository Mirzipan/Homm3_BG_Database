- When gaining a specialty card, the previously gained speciaty cards remain in the hero deck, they previous levels of the specialty are not replaced.
- When leveling up to levels 2, 3, 5, or 7, the [hero](../heroes/index.md) will learn a new [ability](../abilities/index.md). This is done by performing **Search(2)** on the [Abilities](../abilities/index.md) deck.
