# :power: Empower

This mechanic is specifically tied to [spells](../spells/index.md).
The more power a [spell](../spells/index.md) has, the stronger its effect can be.
Depending on the effect, the empowered [spell](../spells/index.md) can deal more damage, provide stronger protection, affect higher [tiers of Units](../units/index.md#tiers), etc.
Each [spell](../spells/index.md) already comes with an option of being used to empower other [spells](../spells/index.md), instead of being used for its usual effect.
