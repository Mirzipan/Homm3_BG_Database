# Attack Die

A die most commonly used during Combat to modify the damage dealt or resolve a special ability of a [unit](../units/index.md).

| Side | Count | Effect |
| :---: | :---: | :-- |
| -1 | 2 |-1 :attack:. |
| 0 | 2 |No change to :attack:. |
| +1 | 2 | +1 :attack: |


## Notes

- When resolving a special ability of a [unit](../units/index.md) or something outside of Combat, the typical effects of each side are instead replaced by whatever other mechanic is currently requiring an Attack Die roll.
