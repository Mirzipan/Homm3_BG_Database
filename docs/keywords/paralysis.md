# :paralysis: Paralysis

## Notes

- A paralyzed unit skips its next activation. Instead of activating, the :paralysis: token is removed from it.
- The :paralysis: token is removed prematurely if the paralyzed unit receives damage. An attack that does not apply any damage does not count towards this.
- If the paralyzed unit received damage from an attack, it will retaliate (if not done so prior during this Combat round).
