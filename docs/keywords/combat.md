# Combat

## Statistics

All [units](../units/index.md) have the following statistics shown on their cards.

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| :attack: | Attack | How much damage this unit will deal to another unit. |
| :defense: | Defense | Decreases the damage received from non-magical sources — damage received cannot be less than 0. |
| :health_points: | Health Points | How much damage this unit can receive, before being removed from Combat. |
| :initiative: | Initiative | How fast the unit is. Higher number means they'll get to activate sooner in Combat. |


## Damage

Also shown as :damage:.

Should a [unit](../units/index.md) receive damage from any source, it will be subtracted from its [health points](combat.md#statistics) directly. The [defense value](combat.md#statistics) only reduces the [attack value](combat.md#statistics) of the attacking [unit](../units/index.md), but not the damage received of the [unit](../units/index.md) that is being attacked.


## Obstacle

Any space that is occupied by a [unit](../units/index.md), an obstacle marker, a Wall or a Gate may not be stepped on.
[Flying units](../units/index.md#flying-units) may move through these spaces, but their movement is not allowed to end in such a space.
