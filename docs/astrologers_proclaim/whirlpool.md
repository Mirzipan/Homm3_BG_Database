<p style="text-align: center;" markdown>Until the next Astrologers' round, Whirlpools can be used without cost. Additionally, all [Heroes](../heroes/index.md) can choose their Whirlpool exit tile instead of making a roll. If there is no [Sea tile](../tiles/index.md#sea-tiles) on the map, ignore this card and draw another one.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" markdown>*People assume that whirlpool is a tunnel, a strict progression from the entrance to the exit, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a fitful funnel of wibbly-wobbly, whirly-whaley... Stuff.*</p>
