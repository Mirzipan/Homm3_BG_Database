# Astrologers Proclaim

Astrologers Proclaim cards are drawn and resolved at the starts of even rounds, right after players get to flip their tokens (Build, Population, Spell Book, Movement) and reset their :expert: expert effect uses.
These cards can have one-time effects or effects lasting during the whole round, sometimes even the following round (until a new Astrologers Proclaim) card is drawn and resolved.
