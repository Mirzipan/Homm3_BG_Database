<p style="text-align: center;" markdown>During this round, players do not draw cards at the start of their turns. Instead, each player draws cards up their :hand:. Then, each of them may discard any number of cards. For every 3 cards discarded this way, they can Remove one [Statistic](../statistics/index.md) card and replace it with an [Empowered Statistic](../statistics/index.md) card of the same type.</p>

## Uwagi

- [^1] The removed [statistic](../statistics/index.md) needs to come from the player's hand. When taking the empowered [statistic](../statistics/index.md), player adds it to their hand.
