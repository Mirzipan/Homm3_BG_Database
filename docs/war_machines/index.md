# War Machines

War machines can be typically purchased either at the [Blacksmith](../fields/war_machine_factory.md) or at the [Trading Post](../fields/trading_post.md).
There may be some [Astrologers Proclaim](../astrologers_proclaim/index.md), [Event](../events/index.md), or [Hero Specialty](../heroes/index.md) cards that allow purchase of War Machines as well.
