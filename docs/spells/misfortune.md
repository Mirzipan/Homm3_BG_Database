## Notes

- The card has to be played immediately after declaring the attack, before other cards are played.
- The result of the Attack die roll is negated, *as well as* all future effects that increase the :attack: of the attacking unit.
- Misfortune can not be played to negate effects of cards that were already played and have already increased the :attack: of the attacking unit. The players should mutually agree if they can no longer play Misfortune after the other effects were played, or if the opponent gets to take his played :attack:-enhancing cards back into their hand.
