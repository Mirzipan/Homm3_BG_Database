## Notes

- Only damage from an attack can be nullified. If the health points are reduced by other means of damage (such as abilities, spells, specialties, etc.), Resurrection cannot be played.
- If damage from an attack is nullified, the resurrected unit will not retaliate, even if it has not performed a retaliation this round.
