## Heroes With A Specialty

- [:might: Lord Haart (Necropolis)](../heroes/lord_haart_necropolis.md#specialty)
- [:might: Tamika](../heroes/tamika.md#specialty)


## Notes

- [^1] **Few** - Should the Dread Knights attack neutral [Crusaders](crusaders.md), when the [Crusaders](crusaders.md) retaliate against a few Dread Knights, they're abilities cancel out and a single [Attack die](../keywords/dice.md#attack-die) is rolled as if it was a regular attack.
