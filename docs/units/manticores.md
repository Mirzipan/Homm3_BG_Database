| Abilities | - | :unit_attack: For this attack, ignore the :defense: value from the target unit's card. | :unit_attack: Place 1 faction cube on the target. When it activates, remove the cube to inflict 1 :damage:. | :unit_passive: After each attack, place 1 faction cube on the target. When it activates, remove the cube to inflict 1 :damage:. | :unit_passive: On a "0" or a "+1" outcomes on the enemy's [Attack die](../keywords/dice.md#attack-die), gain +1 :defense:. |


## Notes

- **Pack** - Only the :defense: value printed on the target unit's card is ignored, bonuses provided by other cards are still valid.
- **Neutral** - When attacked by neutral [Champions](champions.md), the Manticores receive +2 :defense:, as both Attack dice will always end up as a 0 or a 1.
