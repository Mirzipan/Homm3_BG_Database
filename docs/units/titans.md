## Notes

- **Pack** - Only the Pack of Titans are a [:ranged_unit:](index.md#ranged-units). Few Titans are a [:ground_unit:](index.md#ground-units).
- **Few and Pack** - Friendly :ongoing: effects are also ignored.
- **Few and Pack** - Titans ignore the :ongoing: effects of [Buckler of the Gnoll King](../artifacts/buckler_of_the_gnoll_king.md) and [Greater Gnoll's Flail](../artifacts/greater_gnolls_flail.md), but the :instant: effects still apply.
- **Few and Pack** - Should the first effect of the [Orb of Inhibition](../artifacts/orb_of_inhibition.md) be played, the Titans will also not be receiving any damage from [spells](../spells/index.md), as the :ongoing: effect of the [Orb of Inhibition](../artifacts/orb_of_inhibition.md) works on [spells](../spells/index.md) in general and doesn't specifically target Titans.
- [^1] **Few and Pack** - Titans are immune to the effect of [Disrupting Ray spell](../spells/disrupting_ray.md) and the second effect of the [Orb of Inhibition](../artifacts/orb_of_inhibition.md), because their ability is already in play at the time when the other effects are played.
