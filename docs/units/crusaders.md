## Notes

- **Pack and Neutral** - The [Attack die](../keywords/dice.md#attack-die) may be rerolled until the number on the die no longer equals "0".
- [^1] **Neutral** - Should the Crusaders retaliate against a few [Dread Knights](dread_knights.md), they're abilities cancel out and a single [Attack die](../keywords/dice.md#attack-die) is rolled as if it was a regular attack.
