## Types

There are 3 types of units:

- [:unit_ground: Ground Units](index.md#ground-units)
- [:unit_ranged: Ranged Units](index.md#ranged-units)
- [:unit_flying: Flying Units](index.md#flying-units)


### Ground Units

Also shown as :unit_ground:.

Units that move on the ground and can only attack adjacent units.

- [^1] Ground units may move up to 3 spaces in Combat on the small battlefield. On the [large battlefield](../content/battlefield_expansion.md), their movement range is equal to their :initiative: value instead.
- Ground units may move first and then attack during their activation.


### Ranged Units

Also shown as :unit_ranged:.

Units that move on the ground and can also attack units that are not adjacent to them.

- [^1] Ranged units may move up to 1 space in Combat on the small battlefield. On the [large battlefield](../content/battlefield_expansion.md), their movement range is equal to their :initiative: value instead.
- [^1] Ranged units may attack first, and then move. On the [large battlefield](../content/battlefield_expansion.md) they can either move or attack.
- Should an enemy unit occupy any space that is adjacent to the ranged unit, the ranged unit can only attack the adjacent unit.
- Should there be no enemy unit adjacent to the ranged unit, the ranged unit may attack an enemy unit anywhere on the battlefield.
- [^1] Should the ranged attack originate in the back row of the battlefield and the attacked unit is in the opposite back row of the battlefield, a ranged penalty applies. On the [large battlefield](../content/battlefield_expansion.md), the ranged penalty applied when attacking a unit that is 8 or more hexes away.
- There is no retaliation against a ranged attack. There is, however, retaliation if the ranged unit attacks a unit that is adjacent to it.


### Flying Units

Also shown as :unit_flying:.

Flying units move through the air and can only attack adjacent units.

- [^1] Flying units may move up to 3 spaces in Combat on the small battlefield. On the [large battlefield](../content/battlefield_expansion.md), their movement range is equal to their :initiative: value instead.
- [^1] Flying units may attack first, and then move. On the [large battlefield](../content/battlefield_expansion.md), their movement always comes first.
- Flying units may move first and then attack during their activation.
- Flying units may move over obstacles, as long as their movement ends on an empty space.


## Non-Town Units

Normally, units are part of a [Town](../towns/index.md) in which they can be [Recruited](../keywords/recruit.md), but there are some exceptions.


### Neutral Units

Neutral units are variants of regular units, expect they are only used in Neutral Unit Combat.
There are some [Ability](../abilities/index.md), [Astrologers Proclaim](../astrologers_proclaim/index.md), [Event](../events/index.md), and [Hero](../heroes/index.md) specialty cards that allow the player to [Recruit](../keywords/recruit.md) Neutral Units.

There are neutral units that are only used when challenging the guards of a [Creature Bank](../fields/creature_bank.md).
None of these guard units can be [Recruited](../keywords/recruit.md) normally, but some can be gained as a reward for defeating the guards of a [Creature Bank](../fields/creature_bank.md).


### Summoned Units

These units can only comes into Combat by someone casting a summoning [spell](../spells/index.md).
None of these units can be [Recruited](../keywords/recruit.md) normally.

There are currently 4 summoning spells:

- [Summon Air Elemental](../spells/summon_air_elemental.md)
- [Summon Earth Elemental](../spells/summon_earth_elemental.md)
- [Summon Fire Elemental](../spells/summon_fire_elemental.md)
- [Summon Water Elemental](../spells/summon_water_elemental.md)


### Other Units

Although these are not strictly speaking Units, they can be part of Combat and have either Unit-like statistics or effects.

- [Arrow Tower](arrow_tower.md)
- [War Machines](../war_machines/index.md)
