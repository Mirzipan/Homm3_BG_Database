A Creature Bank is not just a single field, it more of a field type, as there are multiple Creature Banks, each with their own set of guard [Units](../units/index.md) and rewards.
They can be either placed on the [Far (Ⅱ-Ⅲ) Map tiles](.,/tiles/index.md#far-tiles) or on the [Near (Ⅳ-Ⅴ) Map tiles](.,/tiles/index.md#near-tiles), based on the Roman numerals printed on the back of each Creature Bank token.


## Combat

When starting Combat at a Creature Bank, the player can place up to 5 of their [units](../units/index.md) in the player deployment zone.
Neutral guard [units](../units/index.md) corresponding to the Creature Bank being visited are then placed randomly in the guards deployment zone.
There is **no round limit** for challenging the Creature Bank guards.


## Difficulty

The [game difficulty](../difficulties.md) level affects the units guarding the Creature Bank by distributing Stacked tokens randomly among them. There can only be one token per unit.
Each token increased a single statistic of a [unit](../units/index.md) the following way:

- +1 :attack:
- +1 :defense:
- +1 :health_points:
- +2 :initiative:

Each difficulty increases the amount of tokens distributed.
The more Stack units there are, the greater the loot once all the guards are defeated.

| Difficulty | Tokens |
| :--- | :---: |
| Easy | 1 |
| Normal | 2 |
| Hard | 3 |
| Impossible | 4 |

## Notes

- Creature Bank Combat has no [field difficulty](../difficulties.md) level, so a Quick Combat is never going to happen at these locations. Additionally, these fields do not provide any :experience:.
