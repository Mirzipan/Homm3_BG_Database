Each player can buy one of these [:spell:](../spells/index.md) for 4 :gold: or 1 :valuables:. If a player buys a card, they immediately shuffle their deck and discard pile along with the newly bought card.</p>

When you approach, you are met by a lone mage in a tattered robe sitting by the entrance. Without looking at you, he says: "Tell me what your hea..." The mage hiccups. "...heart desires. And ale... isle... I'll prepare appperfect spell for that..." he gulps from a vial. "...Sooner'rr'laterr."*</p>
