# Artifacts

Artifacts are divided into 3 tiers: [minor](index.md#minor-artifacts), [major](index.md#major-artifacts), and [relic](index.md#relic-artifacts). These tiers somewhat reflect the overall power of the card, and they are sometimes references by other effects, such as those on [Artifact Merchant event](../events/artifact_merchant.md), [Black Market field](../fields/black_market.md), during the scenario setup, or elsewhere.
These cards typically have two effects, one of which the player must choose when they play the card.


## Minor Artifacts

Minor artifacts have a light blue frame.


## Major Artifacts

Major artifacts have a red frame.


## Relic Artifacts

Relic artifacts have a purple frame.
