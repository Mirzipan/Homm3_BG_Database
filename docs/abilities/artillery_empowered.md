## Notes

- If multiple enemy units share the same (lowest) initiative, the player can choose which of those units should this ability deal damage to.
- The effect can only be played when the [Ballista](../war_machines/ballista.md) activates, which can only happen at the beginning of each Combat round.
- Without an active [Ballista](../war_machines/ballista.md), this ability does nothing.  
- In combination with [Astrologers proclaim week of the Ammo Cart](../astrologers_proclaim/ammo_cart.md) the effect will deal 3 times 2 damage, so 6 damage in total.
