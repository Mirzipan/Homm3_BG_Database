## Notes

- Sorcery may also be played without playing a [spell](../spells/index.md), in order to draw a card. In such case, the spell power bonus is unused and lost.
- Sorcery may be played to first draw a card. A [spell](../spells/index.md) drawn in this way may then be played immediately after being drawn and receive the spell power bonus granted by Sorcery.
