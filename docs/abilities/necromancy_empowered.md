## Notes

- Only the heroes belonging to the [Necropolis Faction](../towns/necropolis.md) may play Necromancy.
- Necromancy may only be used to reinforce units that belong to the [Necropolis Faction](../towns/necropolis.md).
- The reinforcing of units via Necromancy can also take place when the player does not have the Citadel built in their town.
- If a hero that does not belong to the [Necropolis Faction](../towns/necropolis.md) should draw it from the [Ability](index.md) deck, they may put it into the discard pile and draw another card instead. They may also choose to keep the card, they may, however, not play it.
