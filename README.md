## ⚔️ What Is This?
A simple collection of cards contained within the Heroes of Might and Magic 3: The Board Game, that also offers extra explanations for how some cards work or interact with others.

Every now and then I want to see what some cards do, either while theorycrafting about what to play, or even during play, when I want to check or reference something. This database is meant to provide an easy way to find any card contained within the game, including a visual reference and extra information where necessary or applicable.
