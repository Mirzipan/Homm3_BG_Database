    "This artifact only reduces the recruitment cost, it does not allow for an additional recruitment to take place. During a round in which the player already recruited units (their population marker is already turned over), the discount effect provides no benefit, as the player may no longer recruit.",
    "The recruitment discount may be played in combination with cards that allow recruitment (e.g. [Necromancy](../abilities/necromancy.md)).",
    "Should the player recruit outside of their turn, the effect of the Arms of Legion may not be used."
