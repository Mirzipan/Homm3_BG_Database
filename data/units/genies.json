    "**Few** - Should the Genies use their [alternative action](../keywords/alternative_action.md), they are not allowed to move, attack or defend.",
    "**Few** - Exactly 3 cards are discarded from the deck.",
    "**Pack** - Up to 3 cards are discard from the deck. The cards are discarded one after another. The player may decide to stop discarding cards at any time before they reach 3 cards and take a [spell](../spells/index.md) discarded this way to their hand.",
    "**Few and Pack** - Should there not be enough cards to discard from the deck, the cards already discarded by the currently resolving ability are used to form the new discard pile. The old discard pile is then shuffled back into deck, and the remaining cards are discarded. The [spell](../spells/index.md) is then taken from the discarded cards."
