    "The first attack targets a unit directly in front of the Gold Dragons. The second attack targets the unit directly behind the primary target in a straight line. There is no choice here.",
    "The target of the second attack does not carry out a retaliation attack against the Gold Dragons, as it is not adjacent to it.",
    "Should the Gold Dragons attack two units in a line, both of the attacks are resolved first. The retaliation attack will only be carried out after the secondary attack of Gold Dragons has been resolved.",
    "Should the Gold Dragons attack a unit, and the unit directly behind the primary target in a straight line happens to be a friendly unit, then the friendly unit will be the target of their secondary attack.",
    "Should the Gold Dragons attack a Wall, no secondary attack will take place. Units behind the Wall are protected. Should they attack a unit directly in front of a Wall, the Wall will not take any damage."
