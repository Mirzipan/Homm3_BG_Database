    "**Pack and Neutral** - Should the Liches attack an adjacent unit, and afterwards use the secondary attack on a unit that is adjacent to their original target, both of those attacks are resolved first. The retaliation attack will only be carried out after the secondary attack of Liches has been resolved.",
